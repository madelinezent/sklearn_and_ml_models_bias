HOW TO RUN:
In the main directory, go to Deline_Zent_A4. I have made the data file work from any directory, but unfortunately, as much as I tried the fairmlhealth library wouldn't work by using the OS created path. 

STEP 1: In cell 3, you will need to put your local file path for the fair ml health library into the 4th line. This is the only interaction you will need with this notebook. Make the path to the main folder contained within the input folder, The Fair ML Health Library Master folder.

STEP 2: Press run all and sit back and watch the code run.

PART 1: Solution is contained with the jupyter notebook and has a table.png in the output folder as well.
PART2: Fairmlhealth testing is contained within the notebook and my seperate document with conclusions is contained within the output folder.

What's in each folder?
INPUT: Contains the fair ml health library and the german credit dataset
OUTPUT: Contains a picture of the table we needed to generate in part 1 (which is also in the notebook) and a Fairness_Conclusions.txt which explains my conclusions from the

What did I learn?

I feel much more confident in my usage of importing external modules, working with built in models, and determining the fairness of these models. Next time, I hope I'd have time to learn how to use os better to make your life easier.

Final Notes

Thank you for this class! I feel I learned and grew a lot. When I started, I didn't even know how to code 1 line in python but now I know what a neural network is!
